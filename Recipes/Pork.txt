       2          med.  apples coarsely chopped
       7   tablespoons  unsalted butter
       3   tablespoons  brown sugar
       1      teaspoon  vanilla extract
     1/2      teaspoon  ground nutmeg
                        -------seasoning mix--------
       1    tablespoon  salt
       1      teaspoon  onion powder
       1      teaspoon  ground cayenne pepper
     3/4      teaspoon  garlic powder

     1/2      teaspoon  black pepper
     1/2      teaspoon  dried thyme leaves
                        ---pork chop ingredients----
       6  1 3/4" thick  pork chops
     3/4         pound  ground pork
       1           cup  chopped onions
       1           cup  chopped green bell peppers
       2     teaspoons  minced garlic
       1           cup  (4 oz) diced green chilies
       1           cup  chicken stock
     1/2           cup  very fine bread crumbs
     1/2           cup  finely chopped green onions

In a food processor or blender, process the apples, 4 Tablespoons of the butter, the sugar, vanilla and nutmeg until smooth, about 3 to 4 minutes.  Set aside.   In a small bowl thoroughly combine the seasoning mix ingredients; set aside.   Prepare the pork chops by cutting a large pocket (to the bone) into the larger side of each chop to hold the stuffing.   In a large skillet, brown the ground pork in the remaining 3 Tbsp. butter over high heat, about 3 minutes.  Add the onions, bell peppers, garlic, and 2 Tbsp. of the seasoning mix, stirring well; cook about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally and scraping pan bottom well.  Stir in the green chilies and their juice and continue cooking until mixture is well browned, about 6 to 8 minutes, stirring occasionally and scraping the pan bottom as needed. Add the stock and cook 5 minutes, stirring frequently.  Stir in the bread crumbs and cook about 2 minutes more, stirring constantly and scraping pan bottom as needed.  Remove from heat.   Sprinkle the remaining seasoning mix evenly on both sides of the chops and inside the pockets, pressing it in by hand.  Prop chops with pocket side up in an ungreased 13x9-inch baking pan.  Spoon about 1/4 cup stuffing into each pocket; reserve the remaining stuffing.  Bake chops with pocket up at 400F until the meat is done, about 1 hour 10 minutes. Place the remaining stuffing in a small pan in the oven for the last 20 minutes to reheat.   Serve immediately with each chop arranged on top of a portion of the remaining stuffing.

     1/4           cup  finely chopped sweet red or green bell peppers
       1    tablespoon  dried Italian flavored bread crumbs

Heat oven to 400 degrees. Remove mushroom stems; chop enough to make 1/2 cup; reserve. In a medium bowl, place caps, toss with 1 tablespoon of the oil. On a shallow baking pan, arrange mushroom caps, cavity side down; bake until tender, about 10 minutes. In a small skillet, over medium heat, heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil.

Add sausage, onion, pepper and reserved chopped stems; cook and stir, breaking sausage into smaller pieces with a fork, until cooked through, about 5 minutes. Add liquid collected in the baking pan to the sausage mixture; cook until all liquid has evaporated.

Remove from heat; stir in breadcrumbs. Turn mushrooms over, stuff with sausage mixture. Bake until stuffing is browned, about 10 minutes, serve hot.
